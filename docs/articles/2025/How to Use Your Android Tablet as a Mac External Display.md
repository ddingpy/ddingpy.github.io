# How to Use Your Android Tablet as a Mac External Display
- TOC
{:toc}

While Apple's Sidecar feature allows iPads to seamlessly extend a Mac's display, using an Android tablet as a second monitor for your Mac requires third-party applications. Here are some of the most common and effective ways to achieve this:

**1. Paid Solutions (Generally More Reliable):**

* **Duet Display:**
    * **How it works:** Duet Display is a popular choice that offers both wired (USB) and wireless (Wi-Fi) connections. You download the app on your Mac and on your Android tablet.
    * **Pros:** Known for low latency and smooth performance, cross-platform compatibility (Mac, Windows, iOS, Android).
    * **Cons:** It's a paid subscription service.
    * **Setup:**
        1.  Download and install the Duet Display app on both your Mac and your Android tablet.
        2.  Launch the apps on both devices and sign in (you may need to create an account).
        3.  Connect your devices (either wirelessly over Wi-Fi or via USB cable).
        4.  On your Mac, you should see options to extend or mirror your display to the Duet Display virtual monitor.

* **Tab Display:**
    * **How it works:** Tab Display allows you to use your Android tablet as an external display, supporting both Wi-Fi and USB connections (though USB tethering might not be supported for macOS/Android combinations).
    * **Pros:** Users report good quality and full screen utilization.
    * **Cons:** May require fiddling with resolution settings initially.
    * **Setup:**
        1.  Download the macOS client from the official Tab Display website and the app from the Google Play Store on your Android tablet.
        2.  Follow the in-app instructions to connect and configure your devices.

* **Luna Display (Requires Hardware Dongle):**
    * **How it works:** Luna Display is a hardware dongle (USB-C or HDMI) that plugs into your Mac, and then you launch their free apps on your Mac and Android tablet. It connects over Wi-Fi or USB.
    * **Pros:** Designed specifically for this purpose, generally offers excellent performance.
    * **Cons:** Requires a physical dongle, which is an additional cost.
    * **Setup:**
        1.  Plug the Luna hardware into your Mac.
        2.  Launch the free Luna apps on both your Mac and Android tablet.
        3.  Luna should automatically connect your devices.

* **iDisplay:**
    * **How it works:** iDisplay is another established app that allows you to extend your screen to an Android tablet with good frame rates and multi-touch options.
    * **Pros:** Good performance.
    * **Setup:** Similar to Duet Display, involving installing apps on both devices and connecting.

**2. Free/Lower Cost Options (May Require More Fiddling or Have Limitations):**

* **Deskreen + DeskPad:**
    * **How it works:** Deskreen is an open-source solution that mirrors your screen. To get the "second screen" functionality, you can use it in conjunction with DeskPad, which creates a virtual display. You might need a virtual display driver dongle for optimal results, though it can work without it.
    * **Pros:** Free, open-source.
    * **Cons:** Can be a bit more complex to set up, might not be as seamless as paid options.
    * **Setup:**
        1.  Download Deskreen (from deskreen.com) and DeskPad (from GitHub).
        2.  Open DeskPad to create a virtual display.
        3.  Open Deskreen and make the necessary connection. When selecting the screen to share, choose the one provided by DeskPad.

* **AirReceiverLite (or similar AirPlay receiver apps):**
    * **How it works:** Some Android apps act as AirPlay receivers, allowing your Mac to "AirPlay" to them. While AirPlay is primarily for mirroring, some users have reported success in getting extended display functionality with these apps by configuring display settings on the Mac.
    * **Pros:** Potentially free.
    * **Cons:** Primarily designed for mirroring, so extended display functionality might be less reliable or require specific settings. Quality might vary.
    * **Setup:**
        1.  Download an AirPlay receiver app (like AirReceiverLite) on your Android tablet.
        2.  Ensure both your Mac and tablet are on the same Wi-Fi network.
        3.  On your Mac, enable AirPlay (often found in Control Center or Display settings).
        4.  Select the Android tablet from the AirPlay options.
        5.  In your Mac's Display settings, try to change the "Use as" option to "Extended Display" instead of mirroring.

**General Steps for Most Solutions:**

1.  **Download the necessary software:** This usually involves an app for your Mac and an app for your Android tablet.
2.  **Install and launch the apps** on both devices.
3.  **Ensure both devices are on the same Wi-Fi network** if using a wireless connection.
4.  **Connect the devices:** This might involve scanning a QR code, entering a passcode, or simply plugging in a USB cable.
5.  **Configure display settings on your Mac:** Once connected, go to `System Settings` (or `System Preferences`) > `Displays`. You should see your Android tablet listed as an available display. From here, you can:
    * **Extend Display:** Drag windows between your Mac's screen and your Android tablet.
    * **Mirror Display:** Show the same content on both screens.
    * **Arrange Displays:** Drag the display icons to physically match how you've placed your tablet relative to your Mac.
    * **Adjust Resolution and Orientation:** Optimize the display for your tablet's screen.

**Things to Consider:**

* **Wired vs. Wireless:** Wired connections (USB) generally offer lower latency and better performance than wireless (Wi-Fi), especially for demanding tasks.
* **Latency:** Some solutions will have more noticeable lag than others. This is crucial if you plan to use the tablet for tasks requiring quick responsiveness (e.g., drawing).
* **Battery Life:** Using your tablet as a second monitor can drain its battery quickly, especially over Wi-Fi. Keep it plugged in if possible.
* **Resolution and Aspect Ratio:** Ensure the app you choose supports your tablet's native resolution and aspect ratio for the best visual experience.
* **Cost:** Free solutions might come with compromises in performance or ease of use compared to paid options.

Choose the method that best suits your budget, desired performance, and technical comfort level. Many of the paid apps offer free trials, so you can test them out before committing.
